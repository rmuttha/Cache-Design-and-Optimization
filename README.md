# Cache Design and Optimization 

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a custom cache system, which includes understanding and applying various aspects of cache architecture. 
The first step focuses on grasping the fundamental concepts of cache memory.


### 1. Understanding Cache Basics
- **Cache Types**: Direct-mapped, fully associative, set-associative.
- **Block/Line Size**: Number of bytes fetched from memory at a time.
- **Hit/Miss**: Whether data is found in the cache or not.
- **Replacement Policy**: Determines which block to replace when the cache is full (e.g., LRU, FIFO).
- **Write Policy**: How data is written to cache and main memory (Write-through or Write-back).



### 2. Define Cache Parameters
- **Cache Size (C)**: Total size of the cache in bytes.
- **Block Size (B)**: Size of a block in bytes.
- **Associativity (A)**: Number of blocks in each cache set.
  - Direct-Mapped: A = 1
  - Fully Associative: A = C/B
  - N-Way Set Associative: A = N
- **Number of Sets (S)**: Calculated as \( S = \frac{C}{B \times A} \)

### 3. Decoding Addresses
- **Tag**: Identifies if the data is in the cache.
- **Index**: Points to the cache set.
- **Offset**: Identifies the byte within the block.
- **Bits Calculation**:
  - Index Bits: \( \log_2(S) \)
  - Block Offset: \( \log_2(B) \)
  - Tag Bits: \( N - \text{Index Bits} - \text{Block Offset Bits} \)
    

### 4. Data Structures
Implement cache structure using C++:
```cpp
struct CacheLine {
    unsigned int tag;
    bool valid;
    bool dirty;
    std::vector<char> data;  // Store block data
};

struct CacheSet {
    std::vector<CacheLine> lines;
};

class Cache {
public:
    std::vector<CacheSet> sets;
    int associativity;
    int blockSize;
    // Methods for accessing and modifying cache
};
```
### 5. Cache Operations
- **Cache Lookup**: Check if data is in the cache.
- **Handling Cache Miss**: Load block from memory, replace if needed.
- **Write Operations**: Write-through or write-back based on policy.

### 6. Replacement Policy
Implement policies like:

- **LRU**: Replace the least recently used block.
- **FIFO**: Replace the oldest block.
- **Random**: Replace a random block.

### 7. Testing Your Cache
- **Sequential Access**: Test handling of sequential memory access.
- **Random Access**: Test handling of random access patterns.
- **Mixed Access**: Combine sequential and random accesses.

### 8. Performance Analysis
Measure:

- **Hit Rate**
- **Miss Penalty**
- **Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)**: 

AMAT=(Hit Rate×Cache Access Time)+(Miss Rate×Miss Penalty)
Memory Bandwidth

### 9. Optimization
Explore:
- **Prefetching**: Load blocks before they are requested.
- **Victim Cache**: Store recently evicted blocks.
- **Write Buffers**: Temporarily store write operations.

### 10. Final Implementation
- Combine all components in your chosen programming language and run performance tests to verify functionality.
