# Cache Design and Optimization 

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a custom cache system, which includes understanding and applying various aspects of cache architecture. 
The first step focuses on grasping the fundamental concepts of cache memory.

## Completed Steps

### 1. Understanding Cache Basics

#### Cache Types
- **Direct-Mapped Cache**: 
  - Each block of data maps to exactly one cache line. This design is simple but can lead to frequent cache misses if multiple blocks map to the same line.
- **Fully Associative Cache**: 
  - A block of data can be placed in any cache line. This type of cache provides more flexibility and can reduce cache misses compared to direct-mapped caches.
- **Set-Associative Cache**: 
  - A block of data can be placed in one of several cache lines, defined by the set associativity (e.g., 2-way, 4-way). This type balances between direct-mapped and fully associative caches.

#### Block/Line Size
- **Definition**: The size of a block (or line) is the number of bytes fetched from memory at one time. The block size affects cache performance, balancing between fetching more adjacent data (spatial locality) and minimizing cache pollution.

#### Hit/Miss
- **Hit**: Occurs when the requested data is found in the cache, allowing for faster data access.
- **Miss**: Occurs when the requested data is not in the cache, requiring retrieval from the main memory, which is slower. 

#### Replacement Policy
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: 
  - Replaces the block that has not been used for the longest time. It effectively handles data with high temporal locality.
- **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)**: 
  - Replaces the block that was loaded into the cache first, regardless of how often it has been used. Simple but can lead to suboptimal performance.
- **Random Replacement**: 
  - Randomly selects a block for replacement, simple but can lead to unpredictable performance.
- **Most Recently Used (MRU)**: 
  - Replaces the block that was most recently accessed, useful in specific scenarios but generally less common.
- **Least Frequently Used (LFU)**: 
  - Replaces the block that has been accessed the least number of times, good for consistent access patterns.

#### Write Policy
- **Write-Through**: 
  - Data is written to both the cache and main memory simultaneously. Ensures data consistency but can be slower due to increased memory traffic.
- **Write-Back**: 
  - Data is written only to the cache, with updates to the main memory occurring only when the cache block is replaced. Provides better performance but requires tracking of dirty blocks.

# Custom Cache System Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a custom cache system. The first step has been completed, which includes understanding cache basics. The subsequent steps focus on defining cache parameters, decoding addresses, implementing data structures, cache operations, and performance analysis.

## Completed Steps

### 1. Understanding Cache Basics
- **Cache Types**: Direct-mapped, fully associative, set-associative.
- **Block/Line Size**: Number of bytes fetched from memory at a time.
- **Hit/Miss**: Whether data is found in the cache or not.
- **Replacement Policy**: Determines which block to replace when the cache is full (e.g., LRU, FIFO).
- **Write Policy**: How data is written to cache and main memory (Write-through or Write-back).

## Next Steps

### 2. Define Cache Parameters
- **Cache Size (C)**: Total size of the cache in bytes.
- **Block Size (B)**: Size of a block in bytes.
- **Associativity (A)**: Number of blocks in each cache set.
  - Direct-Mapped: A = 1
  - Fully Associative: A = C/B
  - N-Way Set Associative: A = N
- **Number of Sets (S)**: Calculated as \( S = \frac{C}{B \times A} \)

### 3. Decoding Addresses
- **Tag**: Identifies if the data is in the cache.
- **Index**: Points to the cache set.
- **Offset**: Identifies the byte within the block.
- **Bits Calculation**:
  - Index Bits: \( \log_2(S) \)
  - Block Offset: \( \log_2(B) \)
  - Tag Bits: \( N - \text{Index Bits} - \text{Block Offset Bits} \)

### 4. Data Structures
Implement cache structure using C++:
```cpp
struct CacheLine {
    unsigned int tag;
    bool valid;
    bool dirty;
    std::vector<char> data;  // Store block data
};

struct CacheSet {
    std::vector<CacheLine> lines;
};

class Cache {
public:
    std::vector<CacheSet> sets;
    int associativity;
    int blockSize;
    // Methods for accessing and modifying cache
};
```
### 5. Cache Operations
- **Cache Lookup**: Check if data is in the cache.
- **Handling Cache Miss**: Load block from memory, replace if needed.
- **Write Operations**: Write-through or write-back based on policy.

### 6. Replacement Policy
Implement policies like:

- **LRU**: Replace the least recently used block.
- **FIFO**: Replace the oldest block.
- **Random**: Replace a random block.

### 7. Testing Your Cache
- **Sequential Access**: Test handling of sequential memory access.
- **Random Access**: Test handling of random access patterns.
- **Mixed Access**: Combine sequential and random accesses.

### 8. Performance Analysis
Measure:

- **Hit Rate**
- **Miss Penalty**
- **Average Memory Access Time (AMAT)**: 

AMAT=(Hit Rate×Cache Access Time)+(Miss Rate×Miss Penalty)
Memory Bandwidth

### 9. Optimization
Explore:
- **Prefetching**: Load blocks before they are requested.
- **Victim Cache**: Store recently evicted blocks.
- **Write Buffers**: Temporarily store write operations.

### 10. Final Implementation
- Combine all components in your chosen programming language and run performance tests to verify functionality.
